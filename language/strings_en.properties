whathash=what is blockchain？
whathash1=the blockchain is essentially a shared database, data or information stored in it. It has the characteristics of unforgeable, traceable throughout, traceability, openness and transparency, and collective maintenance.
whathash2=centralized wallet? Decentralized wallet? Why can`t the centralized wallet check the transfer?
whathash3=click to see the difference between blockchain wallets
whathashlink=(low probability event definition)
whathash4=for example: your own wallet address is A, you transfer 10 USDT to address E, but you use the transaction hash value to query, you can only query a random ledger address B (or C or D, etc.) of the service provider Transfer with E. In the same way, E cannot know whether you transferred the 10 USDT, because E can only see that the ledger address B transferred him 10 USDT. This is why centralized wallets cannot query the real transfer information on the blockchain.
whathash5=why do I win or not win a lottery consecutively？
whathash6=first of all, it is a small probability event that does not win the prize many times in a row.
whathash7=，secondly, winning and not winning are random events, and the frequency of random events tends to a stable value. In the case of non-iteration, the probability of things appearing is equal to everyone. In this case, everyone is fair. At the same time, random events will follow the law of large numbers (under the condition of the same experiment, repeat the test for many times, the frequency of random events is similar to its definition of the law of probability of large numbers), in the case of increasing frequency of transfers, winning and not winning The probability of will tend to a stable value. So please continue to transfer, as the frequency of transfer increases, the total probability of winning will increase.
whathash8=why is it delayed?？
whathashdoc=click to view the speed dilemma of the blockchain: "Trust is the most important thing, but it's too slow."
